    "## Problem 0: RRT Planner Implementation\n",
    "Implement the following and ensure the unit tests pass (be sure to read the headers for each function).\n",
    "* `chap12/planner_utilities.py`:\n",
    "  * `plan_path(...)`\n",
    "  * `find_closest_configuration(...)`\n",
    "  * `generate_random_configuration(...)`\n",
    "  * `find_shortest_path(...)`\n",
    "  * `smooth_path(...)`\n",
    "* `chap12/rrt_straight_line.py`:\n",
    "  * `create_rrt_plan(...)`  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints on implementation\n",
    "* `np.random.rand()` can be used to calculate a random number between 0 and 1\n",
    "* Take a good look at `MsgWaypoints`\n",
    "  * See the documentation for `Waypoint` in `msg_waypoints.py`\n",
    "  * `tree.connect_to_goal.item(i)` make sure to set and use the `connect_to_goal` property of `MsgWaypoints`. This is used to indicate that this waypoint could be connected to the goal, not that it is the goal waypoint.\n",
    "    * Note that you do not ever need to add the goal waypoint to the tree structure, you just set \n",
    "  * Waypoints can be added by either adding a `Waypoint` through `add_waypoint(...)` or through specifying the values of the waypoint through `add(...)`. Waypoint data can be accessed individually or by calling the `get_waypoint(...)` function to extract all of the data for the waypoint\n",
    "  * `tree.parent.item(i)` will return the parent of the waypoint at index `i`. Make sure to set the parent value appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on the unit tests\n",
    "There will only be unit tests for `plan_path(...)`, `find_closest_configuration(...)`, `find_shortest_path(...)`, and `smooth_path(...)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will **be no** unit tests for `generate_random_configuration(...)` and `create_rrt_plan(...)`"
